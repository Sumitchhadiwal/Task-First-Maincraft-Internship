## House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Internship Task – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (Task 1)

---

### 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices using the **California Housing dataset** provided by scikit-learn. The objective is to demonstrate the complete machine learning workflow including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and reporting using Python and popular ML libraries.

This project is designed for academic and internship portfolio purposes.
